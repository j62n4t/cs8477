•             The   building was   purchased   on   March   1;   20-year   estimated   useful   life   (zero   residual   value)
•             The   8-year   loan was   signed   on   June   1;   interest   accrues   each   year;   terms   of   the   loan   state   that   a   cash   payment   for   principle   and   all accrued interest will   be   paid   on the maturity   date   of   the   loan   in   2028.

•          *NOTE: (not   an   adjusting JE):      *The   FV-OCI   Investment   showed   an   unrealized   loss   of   $2,000.   This   needs   updating.
•          IGNORE/OMIT   INCOME   TAXES   FOR THE   INCOME   STATEMENT   in   this   lab.
Prepare   the   Adjusted   Trial   Balance, as   at   December   31, 2020 for   BB   Corp.   Prepare   the   2020   financial   statements       (Comprehensive   Income Statement, Statement of Changes inEquity   and   a   Classified   Balance   Sheet)   in   good   form.
Your   final submission should be edited carefully   for organization, column   width, clarity, headings, etc.
Present   the   adjusting   journal   entries   at   the   top   left   of   your   Excel   sheet.    Omit   all   instruction   wording; omit   the Unadjusted Trial Balance.   DO NOT   include dollar   signs in   your   journal entries!!! Leave one   row   space   between   JEs.To   the right of   the adj JEs, on   the Excel sheet, present   the   Adjusted   Trial Balance.   Only   write a one-line   title   for each   financial   statement   (name   of   the   statement      “Dec   31, 2020).   Below   this, present   your   Income   Statement   (include       Service Rev as an “Other” revenue).   To   the right of   the income statement, present   your Statement of Changes in   Equity.   BELOW   this, present   your clearly   formatted Balance Sheet. Classify   the N/R as a current asset.   Use   formulas   in all cells (in all   financial statements    the   Adj   Trial Balance)   where appropriate, to add, deduct and carry-over   amounts, etc.   You   will need   to plan carefully,   for column   widths   to appear in an organized and presentable   way. Keep   in   mind   that   balance   sheet   classification   headings   should   ideally   be   bolded.   Account   names, below   each   balance   sheet classification heading, should be INDENTED. Format and presentation are a high percentage of   the lab grade.
